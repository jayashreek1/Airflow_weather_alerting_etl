# Why Airflow?

## Imagine This… (Without Airflow)

You’re a data engineer at a weather monitoring company. Your daily tasks:
- Every morning at 6 AM, fetch temperature data from an API.
- Clean the data (remove errors, missing values).
- Store it in a database.
- Send an alert email if temperature crosses 40°C.

So, you write Python scripts for each step:
``
- `fetch_data.py`
- `clean_data.py`
- `store_data.py`
- `send_alert.py`
``

**But…**
- How do you ensure they run in the right order?
- What if `fetch_data.py` fails—should the others still run?
- How do you run this every day without forgetting?
- What if tomorrow your manager says:  
  *“Also fetch humidity, and do it every 15 minutes”*?

Suddenly, your simple scripts become a nightmare:
- Writing cron jobs for scheduling.
- Handling failures manually.
- Checking logs by hand.
- Getting woken up at 2 AM because something broke.

## Enter Airflow (The Hero)

With Airflow, your workflow becomes magical:
- Draw a simple flowchart (DAG):  
  **Fetch → Clean → Store → Alert**
- Airflow knows the order, retries failed steps, and logs everything.
- You schedule: *“Run this every day at 6 AM”* → Airflow handles it.
- Need to add humidity? Drag one more task in the DAG. Done.
- Want to check last night’s run? The Airflow UI shows it clearly.
