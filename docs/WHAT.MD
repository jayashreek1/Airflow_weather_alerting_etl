# üå¨Ô∏è What is Apache Airflow?

Apache Airflow is an **open-source tool** for **orchestrating workflows**.  
That means it helps you **schedule, organize, and monitor tasks** that need to run in a specific order.

---

## ‚úÖ Simple Definition
**Airflow = A smart scheduler for your data workflows.**  
You tell it:
- **What tasks to run**
- **In what order**
- **When to run them**

Airflow makes sure they **happen automatically and reliably**.

---

## Key Points
- Workflow = sequence of tasks to run.
- Authentication & authorization available in Airflow UI.
- Supports Docker, SaaS, and enterprise environments.
- Can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- Tasks are idempotent (safe to retry without side-effects).

---

## üéØ Why Was Airflow Created?
Before Airflow, people used **cron jobs** or custom scripts to schedule tasks.  
This caused problems like:
- Hard to **manage dependencies** (Task B should run after Task A)
- No easy way to **monitor failures**
- Difficult to **retry tasks** or **reschedule**

Airflow solves these by:
- Allowing you to **write workflows as code (in Python)**
- Visualizing workflows in a **beautiful web UI**
- Managing **dependencies, retries, and logs automatically**

---
## Example Workflows
- ETL pipelines
- Automated reporting
- Notifications
- Data backup jobs
