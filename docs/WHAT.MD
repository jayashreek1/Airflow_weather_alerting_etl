# üå¨Ô∏è What is Apache Airflow?

Apache Airflow is an **open-source tool** for **orchestrating workflows**.  
That means it helps you **schedule, organize, and monitor tasks** that need to run in a specific order.

---

## ‚úÖ Simple Definition
**Airflow = A smart scheduler for your data workflows.**  
You tell it:
- **What tasks to run**
- **In what order**
- **When to run them**

Airflow makes sure they **happen automatically and reliably**.

---

## Key Points
- Workflow = sequence of tasks to run.
- Authentication & authorization available in Airflow UI.
- Supports Docker, SaaS, and enterprise environments.
- Can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- Tasks are idempotent (safe to retry without side-effects).
