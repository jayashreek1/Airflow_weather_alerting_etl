# What is Airflow

Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

## Key Points
- Workflow = sequence of tasks to run.
- Authentication & authorization available in Airflow UI.
- Supports Docker, SaaS, and enterprise environments.
- Can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- Tasks are idempotent (safe to retry without side-effects).

## Example Workflows
- ETL pipelines
- Automated reporting
- Notifications
- Data backup jobs
